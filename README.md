<b>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</b>
The Gaming Room is mobile game developer which wanted to expand one of it's successful competitive puzzel games, "Draw It or Lose It", from the Android platform to multiple other platforms and devices.

<b>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</b>
I think I made a strong case for using the Windows server OS with a particular focus on the API framework, distributed networks, and security.

<b>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>
Using the UML class diagram to help build an understanding of the structure and relationship between classess methods and other application components to build functional code.

<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>
The compare/contract section between different OS platforms (Mac/Linux/Windows/Mobile) could use more nuance and depth to explain differences with subsections for each platform on costs, expected performance, expertise, development tools, even particular browsers and which versions are most commonly found on each platform.

<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>
Speed, functionality, and security were the main user needs. The game should be quick to load, and work correctly everytime, because without these considerations the game's users will not play the game and revenue for the client will be negatively affected. Security ensures payment information or other sensitive data is properly encrypted to industry standards.

<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>
To design this I started with planning the software with a general bird eye's view of the clients business objectives and decomposed those into functional requirements. While planning, these functional requirements becomes the post-marks for technical requirements which become the mile-markers for architecture and code to fulfill the client needs. Once the planning was complete I had several iterations of code which mirrored the planning process, with each iteration becoming more specific and growing in complexity until it reached the client needs.
